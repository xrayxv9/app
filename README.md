# FIRST EVER HUGE PROJECT

## THE GOAL

This project has for goal to teach me how to create a simple application using the C langage.
I will also try to use versionning on it to at least understand how to use it.

## THE APP

This application will have (I hope) a simle interface on which you will have two buttons
the first one will be there to see what was added throughout the time.
And the second button will be there just to add new things.

### WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT ?

I'm talking about pastries,
the goal is to make sort of a database in which you will have different kind of pastries.


May the force be with me !
